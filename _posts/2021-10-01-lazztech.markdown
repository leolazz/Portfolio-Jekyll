work: Onboarding posed a number of challenges due to the large established code base and the lack of any prior experience. Quickly though, I implemented a performance improvement feature to paginate in-app notifications. Thereafter, in the process of adding a feature to streamline the process of inviting friends, I implemented migrations, and set a pattern for future migrations using multiple database technologies with TypeORM. This included rolling the update in a date safe way to the production database.
