work: Onboarding posed a number of challenges due to the large established code base and the lack of any prior experience. Although, I was able work a performance improvement feature to paginate in-app notfications. Thereafter, in the process of adding a feature to streamline the process for inviting friends I impletmented and set a pattern for migrations using multiple database technologies with TypeORM. This included rolling the update in a date safe way to the production database.
