work-involved:
challenges: Being onboarded to a large established code base, in a tech stack I had no prior experience. Worked perf improvement feature to paginate in-app notfications. In the procces of implementing in-app pagination I implemented, and set a pattern for migrations using multiple database technologies with TypeORM. Additonally, streamlined the process for inviting friends, by inserting a new UUID column to a production database in a data safe way.
