description: Online platform for tracking projects and tasks
why: After spending hundreds of hours watching course lectures, working through examples, and challenge projects, I wanted to create something on my own separate from any guided material. Since I wasn't confident with my skill level at the time I decided to use a contrived project idea. Moreover, this way I could start immediately, focusing more on the development process and larger patterns. Rather than having an extended planning and design phase that would result from a more original idea.
whyBullets: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>exercise skills & knowledge from various courses</li>
  <li>serve as a cumulative demonstration of knowledge and ability at the time</li>
  <li>Learn additional skills, while solidifying prior learning</li>
  <li>break out of hand holding learning process of courses</li>
  </ul>
challengesB1: <ul class="ul-p">

  </ul>
challengesB2: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Learning and adhering to S.O.L.I.D. principles</li>
  <li>Difficulty of rapidly learning:</li>
  <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>docker and dockerizing the application</li>
  <li>Kubernetes and deployment</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
results: Solidified prior lessons, learned  Dev-Ops technologies, greatly increased confidence in skill level, and gained a clearer understanding of the reality of software development.
