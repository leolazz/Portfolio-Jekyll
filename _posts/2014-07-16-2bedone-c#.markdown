description: Online platform for tracking projects and tasks
why: After spending hundreds of hours watching course lectures, working through example, and challenges projects, I wanted to create something on my own seperate from any guided material. Since I wasn't confident with my skill level at the time I decided to use a contrived project idea. Moreover, this way I could start immediately, focusing more on the development proccess and larger patterns. Rather than, having an extended planning and design phase that would could result from more orignal idea.
whyBullets: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>exercise skills & knowledge from various courses</li>
  <li>serve as a cumulative demonstration of knowledge and ability at the time</li>
  <li>Learn addittional skills, while solidifying prior learning</li>
  <li>break out of hand holding learning process of courses</li>
  </ul>
challengesB1: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Beginner level experience and knowledge</li>
  <li>Working to complete project quickly while solidifying new information.</li>
  <li>Not getting lost in the minutiae of less relevant aspects.</li>
  </ul>
challengesB2: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Learning and adhering to S.O.L.I.D. principles</li>
  <li>unforseen exposure and dificulting of rapidly learning:</li>
  <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>docker and dockerizing the application</li>
  <li>Kubernetes and deployment</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
results: Solidified prior lessions, learned  Dev-Ops technologies, greatly increased confidence in skill level, and gained a clearer understanding of the reality of software development.
