why: While getting on boarded to work the LazzTech hub app I relized that since it was alreadly to so far into development there would be aspects of this new stack I would not get exposure to so I decided to rebuild 2BeDone in the same stack to accelerate the onboarding increase my breadth of knowledge and experience in this new stack.
