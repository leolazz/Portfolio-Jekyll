why: While getting on boarded to work the LazzTech hub app I relized that since it was alreadly to so far into development there would be aspects of this new stack I would not get exposure to so I decided to rebuild 2BeDone in the same stack to accelerate the onboarding increase my breadth of knowledge and experience in this new stack.
whyBullets: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Accelerate on boarding</li>
  <li>expand my understanding of a new stack</li>
  <li>learn about developing a dedicated cross platform experience</li>
  </ul>
challenges:
challengesB1: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>aiming to quickly to complete the project while:</li>
  <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>working on the Lazztech Hub</li>
  <li>Trying to differentiate it from the orignal</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
challengesB2: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Learning the "gotchas" of Apollo and its state managment </li>
  <li>The complexity learning configuring and learning GraphQL</li>
  </ul>
results: Once again learned a new tech stack and improved my overall skill and knowledge base. Moreover, in this process I found my preffered stack.
