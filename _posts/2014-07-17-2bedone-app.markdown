why: While getting on boarded to work the Lazztech hub app I realized that since it was already to so far into development there would be aspects of this new stack I would not get exposure to. I decided to rebuild 2BeDone in this new stack to accelerate the onboarding and increase my breadth of knowledge and experience in this new stack.
whyBullets: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Accelerate on boarding to lazztech hub</li>
  <li>expand my understanding of a new stack</li>
  <li>learn about designing for a dedicated cross platform experience</li>
  </ul>
challenges:
challengesB1: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>aiming to quickly to complete the project while:</li>
  <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>working on the Lazztech Hub</li>
  <li>Trying to differentiate it from the original version</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
challengesB2: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Learning the nuances and complexity of:</li>
  <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Configuration and utilization of GraphQL</li>
  <li>integrating apollo and its state management</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Monolithic size of Angular at first exposure</li>
  </ul>
results: Increased overall skill and knowledge base in a new tech stack while accelerating the onboarding process to the Lazztech Hub, and in the process found my preferred stack.
