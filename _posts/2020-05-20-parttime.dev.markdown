description: A part-time work job board for developers & related fields
why: For this project I was seeking a more robust and complex backend domain challenge that could actually become usable product for the target audience, rather than just throw away project. I aimed to create a front end that felt responsive, streamlined, and focused only on the business domain.
whyBullets: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>immersively & rapidly learn a entirely new stack</li>
  <li>Tackle a more complex backend domain challenge</li>
  <li>Limit myself to simple frontend focused solely on the business domain</li>
  </ul>
challenges:
challengesB1: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>changing dev environment from PC to Mac and from visual studio to VS code</li>
  <li>Learning about device and browser fingerprints in order to</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Avoid bot detection, without any paid services</li>
  <li>Employ preventative counter measures</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
challengesB2: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Learning to traverse the DOM using a headless browser</li>
  <li>optimizing the scraping C.R.U.D. operation to be stable, lightweight, and fast in a deployment on a limited resource environment </li>
  <li>Dockerize and deploying the backend with an instance of chromium into a kubernetes cluster</li>
  </ul>
results: In addition to learning a new stack, becoming more capable and comfortable in it than my original, I improved my mental model of the DOM in order to traverse it in a headless environment, and greatly improved my skill level in Dev-Ops technologies like <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.
