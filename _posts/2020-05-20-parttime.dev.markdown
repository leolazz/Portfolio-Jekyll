description: A job board for developers & related fields to find part time work opportunities
why: For my first project I used a simple, contrived idea in order to allow me to focus on the actual development process and patterns. Nonetheless, I spent much more time than was nessacary on the front-end design. Therefore, I wanted to tackle a more complex backend domain challenge, and limit myself to a simple front-end design.
whyBullets: <ul>
  <li>Rapidly learn a entirely new stack</li>
  <li>Focus on a greater backend domain challange</li>
  <li>Created a simple frontend focused soley on the business domain</li>
  </ul>
challenges:
challengesB1: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Parsing the legality of scraping different sources</li>
  <li>Learning about device and browser fingerprints in order to</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Avoid bot detection, without any paid services</li>
  <li>Employ preventative measures</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
challengesB2: <ul class="ul-p">
  <li>Learning to traverse the DOM using a headless browser</li>
  <li>Making a stable, lightweight, and fast CRUD operation for deployment on a limited resource enviroment</li>
  <li>Dockerizing and deploying the backend with an instance of chromemium into a kubernetes cluster</li>
  </ul>
results: While learning a new stack and becoming more capable in it than my original I also, improved my mental model of the DOM in order to traverse it in a headless enviroment and greatly improved my skill level in Dev-Ops technologies like <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.
